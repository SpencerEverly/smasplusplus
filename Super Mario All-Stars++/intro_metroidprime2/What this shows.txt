1. I've always dreamed of creating a Youtube intro in front of all my videos but I've never had enough money at the times during which I was solely focused on doing so. Plus I don't know how Youtube intros work anyway so.
2. Generic SMB3 because we all love SMB3 11/10 overrated game
3. Haven't we always wished we could have a proper Metroid episode? I used a bunch of hidden Metroid Prime-inspired graphics I have somewhere to make a good representation of what I would hope to see.
4. Because Link is underrated. Seriously people. Y u no Link.
5. Oh no, Larry stole the Princess! Halp gais!
6. ...I dunno if I'll ever finish this episode. I can try though eventually. I'll let you know.
7. THE WORST FREAKING LEVEL IN SUPER MARIO FOREVER X. LOL.

A lot of these are personal to me, and that's why I specially chose them. Enjoy!
